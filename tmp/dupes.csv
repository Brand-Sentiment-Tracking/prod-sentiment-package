363,Disney's Battle with DeSantis Proves Costly as Florida Officials Look to Revoke Company's 'Self-Governing' Status,"In the aftermath of Disney’s attack on Florida officials for passing a bill to strengthen parental rights, Florida Republicans are taking a new look at 55-year-old legislation that has given the company vast power to make its own rules inside Walt Disney World near Orlando.

The bill, officially named Parental Rights in Education, largely focuses on procedures to ensure that parents can be informed of any services that students receive at school.

About halfway through the bill, it says, “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”

That clause was attacked by liberals and led to Disney condemning the bill, saying the law “should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,” according to Fox News.

DeSantis said that if Disney wants to get heavily involved in politics, then perhaps it no longer deserves to be above the rules.

Disney has a ‘Diversity and inclusion manager’? How special. 🙄 My sisters & cousins had so much fun in Fort Wilderness every summer growing up. It’s sad they’re going woke.

“What I would say as a matter of first principle is I don’t support special privileges in law just because a company is powerful and they’ve been able to wield a lot of power,” DeSantis said Thursday during a news conference in West Palm Beach.

Disney threw its weight around last year in a Florida bill to curb the power of Big Tech, DeSantis said, adding: “I’m thinking to myself, ‘This is ridiculous. Honestly, it was embarrassing.”

DeSantis suggested that special treatment for Disney has evolved to the point where it needs to be reviewed and perhaps cut back.

“I think what has happened is there’s a lot of these special privileges that are not justifiable, but because Disney had held so much sway, they were able to sustain a lot of special treatment over the years,” he said.

Republican state Rep. Spencer Roach said the process of treating Disney like everybody else has already begun.

“Yesterday was the 2nd meeting in a week w/fellow legislators to discuss a repeal of the 1967 Reedy Creek Improvement Act, which allows Disney to act as its own government,” Roach tweeted. “If Disney wants to embrace woke ideology, it seems fitting that they should be regulated by Orange County.”

Disney has “lost a lot of the pull that they used to have” after siding against parents, DeSantis said, calling that a “good thing for our state because the state should be governed by the best interest of the people.”

“I would say any special privileges that are in law I would like to get rid of generally,” he said.

“I think in this particular case with Disney, I just don’t think you have very many people in the legislature anymore who are going to be able to defend a lot of what has been done over many years to really have them almost govern themselves in some of these things. That was probably never appropriate to start but is certainly not appropriate now at this point,” DeSantis said.

425,"Texas Woman Walks Into 7-Eleven, Goes Viral for Exposing Blatant Scam Happening Right in the Open","If you’re not paying attention to the credit card reader at your local convenience store, you could be in for a rude awakening. Nyshje Rattler found that out the hard way — but she ended up going viral taking down the fraudsters who ripped her off.

According to KXAS-TV, Rattler became a TikTok sensation when the McKinney, Texas, resident took a video of herself ripping a credit card skimmer off a card reader at a local 7-Eleven after she found out her bank account had been drained.

(Here at The Western Journal, we bring you critical stories that could affect you, including fraud warnings — and we do it all from a Christian, conservative perspective. You can help support our mission by subscribing.)

Rattler told the NBC affiliate that she first discovered something was up when she tried to buy a bag of potato chips at the convenience store last week.

“They said: You don’t have the money. And I said: Excuse me?” Rattler said.

She called her bank and found her account had been “wiped clean.”

“They said $300 was spent at Walmart in Houston. $200 at a Walmart in Katy. $187 at a Walmart in Houston,” Rattler said.

“I was like, ‘That’s not me.'”

So, who had her card information? She traced back the purchases she made and realized she’d made a purchase on March 21 at a 7-Eleven on McKinney’s Medical Center Drive.

Rattler also remembered that the cashier was unusually finicky regarding how she used the credit card reader — and remembered hearing about credit card skimmers in Los Angeles. Skimmers are placed over machines to swipe an individual’s card data, which can then be used to make purchases illegally.

According to KTVT-TV, police said “the skimmer is made up of a replacement cover, likely purchased online by a criminal, outfitted with a computer board that can be accessed wirelessly, and placed on top of the store’s identical credit card reader.”

“He [the cashier] was obsessive about how I placed the pen down so I thought that was weird,” Rattler said. “I kept replaying it in my head.”

In one of her TikTok videos, she also said the cashier directed her to use the machine with the skimmer, which isn’t normally the card reader she uses.

When she went back to the store and looked at the machines, she noted there was a difference between them.

“I compared the two and I noticed that the one I grabbed was bulkier on the side, kind of sticking out. It wasn’t flat like they said. So, I just lifted it up and it came up,” Rattler said.

She posted a video of the moment to TikTok — which has been viewed over 21 million times in its first week.

According to a spokeswoman for the McKinney Police Department, it came up easily thanks to the fact that skimmers like these are only held on by a bit of adhesive.

“You can actually try to jiggle it. Try to pull it,” spokeswoman Carla Marion Reeves said. “There’s some double-sided tape that is used to keep them down, nothing more, so criminals can easily take it.”

Reeves said the skimmer “is being forensically examined right now.”







“I think it’s really smart of her to sit down and really think about where the compromise actually happened,” police Corp. Melissa Taylor told KTVT regarding Rattler.

“These are double-backed, taped on in most cases, so if you try to pull the cover off at the ATM, the keypad or the point that put your credit card in is going to come off,” Taylor said.

Rattler told NBC News that people could tell the difference between a regular card reader and a reader that’s been tampered with through one dead giveaway: looking for a gap.







“The way that you can tell is that the machine should be flat on the side,” she said. “There should be no gaps. So I started comparing the two and the one to the right, it had a gap.”

Was this an inside job? Yes No

As for whether it was an inside job, it’s impossible to tell. The McKinney Police Department told KXAS that at least one other potential victim of the card skimmer at that 7-Eleven had come forward. However, the police officer leading the investigation wasn’t available for comment.

In a statement, 7-Eleven said it “takes allegations involving card skimmers very seriously. 7-Eleven inspects gas pumps and card readers regularly and cooperates closely with law enforcement regarding related investigations.”

Relying on 7-Eleven, however, isn’t ideal — particularly after your bank account has been wiped clean.

Let Nyshje Rattler’s experience be a lesson to all of us: Being hit with a case of credit card fraud could be as close as your next bag of chips.

Tammy Rivera and Waka Flocka first opened up about their romance on “Love And Hip Hop Atlanta.” While it was clear that the rapper cared for Tammy very much, their issues were hard to ignore. For Tammy, she struggled to move past Waka’s infidelities. Being cheated on was very painful for Tammy. In fact, it made it hard for her to trust Waka. So their relationship became contentious at times. Tammy made the decision to end the relationship. However, they eventually decided to give it another go. After they left LHHATL, they moved on to “Growing Up Hip Hop.” But they really opened up about the state of their marriage on “What the Flocka.”
